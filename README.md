# Shoppingo Project Repository

Welcome to the Shoppingo project repository! Developed during my internship at InternPe, Shoppingo is a frontend prototype for an e-commerce platform designed to provide users with a seamless online shopping experience.

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I crafted this project to showcase the user interface of a modern online shopping website. While dynamic features are not currently integrated, the prototype offers a glimpse into the potential functionality and aesthetics of a fully realized e-commerce platform.

Throughout the development process, I leveraged tools such as Figma and eraser.io for UI design, ensuring a visually appealing and intuitive layout. Additionally, Canva and Photoshop were utilized for editing photos and creating graphics, enhancing the overall presentation of the website.

This repository serves as a testament to my skills in frontend web development and UI design. While it focuses solely on the frontend aspect, it lays a solid foundation for future integration with backend functionalities.

Explore the code, provide feedback, and envision the possibilities of transforming Shoppingo into a fully functional online marketplace. Let's shape the future of e-commerce together!
